<a name="insall"></a><h2>1. Installing the software</h2>
One of the goals of this software was to make administration as easy as
possible. In particular, you never need to run scripts etc. In principle,
to install this software you just unpack the zip file in some directory
in your web tree (call it the BASE directory), point your browser at that
directory and off you go.<br/>
<br/>
However, that method of installation requires the web-server to be able
to write files in the web-tree, which in some cases is considered a
security risk. I therefore provide also a non-web-based installation
method, as explained below.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Prerequisites.</b>
This is a PHP/MySQL software, which means that to use it you must have
a MySQL server and a PHP engine (and your web-server must supports PHP
and MySQL). I tested the software with PHP 4.3.9 and MySQL 4.1.20 (and
earlier versions of it were tested with PHP 4.3.2 and MySQL 3.23). It
may work even with older versions but I cannot test it.  Also, proper
functioning of this software depends on "proper" functioning of you
web-server. In particular, some issues that I came across are:
<ul>
<li>The web-server (and the PHP engine) must be willing to upload files.
  For example, in one system that I used to test it, the PHP engine was
  configured to only allow uploads of files upto 500KB (and I was wrecking
  my brains as to why I can only upload pdf and not postscript files..) In
  my case it turned out that I had to change the parameter LimitRequestBody
  in php.conf (which on that system was somewhere under /etc/httpd/).<br/>
</li>

<li>The web-server must be able to send email. For example, if this is a
  Windows machine then the variable SMTP in php.ini should be set correctly.
<br/></li>

<li>If the server is set-up with PHP in safe mode, then everything under the
  BASE directory must have same owner. (Also everything under the UPLOAD
  directory -- see below.) If safe_mode_gid is set in php.ini then instead
  of having the same owner they need to have the same group.<br/> 
</li>
</ul>

<b>Experimenting with the software.</b>
I wrote a small testing package for the purpose of experimenting with the
software. To use this package, copy the contents of the <tt>"testOnly"</tt>
subdirectory to the BASE directory where you installed the software itself
<i>before</i> you customize the installation. This testing package adds 53
dummy submissions and 17 dummy PC members to the conference database.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Troubleshooting.</b>
Most of the parameters of the software are stored in the <tt>"parameters"</tt>
table in the database. The details of the database itself are stored in the
file <tt>init/confParams.php</tt> under the BASE directory. If you have
problems with the software, looking at these parameters may provide
some hints as to the source of the problem.

<a name="webBased"></a><h3>1a. Web-based installation</h3>
To use this method, simply copy the contents of the webtree directory
to somewhere in your web tree (call it the BASE directory), making sure
that the web-server has permission to write in the <tt>"init"</tt>
sub-directory of the BASE directory. After copying the files to the BASE
directory (and setting the permissions), point your browser to the page
<tt>chair/initialize.php</tt> under the BASE directory. In this form you
need to specify various details that are neeed for initializing the new
site:
<dl>
<dt><a name="webServer"></a><b>Web Server.</b> 
The DNS name or IP address of the web server, as accessed by the users of
this software. This parameter is used when the software sends emails and
needs to specify the address where some pages can be found. (Note that
in some cases the administrator may use a different address. For example,
the administrator uses "<tt>http://localhost/confName/</tt>" while everybody
else uses "<tt>http://www.severName.org/confName/</tt>". In this case
the chair needs to enter the latter address on the customization page.)
<br/><br/> 
</dt>

<dt><a name="SQLserver"></a><b>MySQL Server.</b> 
This parameter tells the PHP scripts where to look for the MySQL server. In
common installations the same host runs both the web-server and the MySQL
server. If this is not the case (i.e., the web server communicates with a
back-end database that is hosted on a different machine) then you need to
check the radio-button for "The MySQL server runs on a different host" and
provide the DNS name or IP address of the machine that hosts the MySQL server.
<br/><br/> 
</dt>

<dt><a name="SQLuser"></a>
<b>MySQL Administrator or MySQL Database and User.</b>
There are two ways to create a database for use with the submission and review
software:</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If you have administrative access to the MySQL server, you can simply
enter the administrator username and password and the software will
automatically create a new database. The "administrator" whose details are
thus specified should have sufficient privileges to DROP and CREATE databases
and to GRANT access privileges on these databases.<br/>
<br/></li>

<li>If you do not know the username/password of the MySQL administrator,
you should create the database for this conference by some other means.
(For example, some hosted sites have a "control panel" that lets users
create new databases. In other sites one must ask the administrator to
create new databases.)<br/>
<br/> 
Once you created the database, enter in the form the database name and the
MySQL username/password that are needed to access it.</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/> 
</dd>

<dt><a name="UploadDir"></a>
<b>UPLOAD directory.</b> This is the local directory where the uploaded
submissions would be stored. If you do not specify anything in this field,
the UPLOAD directory defaults to the subdirectory <tt>"subs"</tt> under the
BASE directory. The UPLOAD directory need not be in the web-tree, but the web
server must be able to read and write in that directory.<br/><br/> 
</dt>
<dt><a name="chairEmail"></a><b>Program Chair email.</b>
In this field you can specify either just an email address or also the name
(in the form <tt>Name &lt;email&gt;</tt>). If you do not specify the chair's
name, it will default to something like <tt>"&lt;conf-name&gt; Chair"</tt>.
The email addresses that you specify here will be used as the program chair's
username for the purpose of accessing the review site.<br/>
<br/>
The chair's email will also be CC'ed on every email that is sent to authors
of submitted papers, including submission/revision confirmations, the final
decision notifications and the comments for authors. The address that you
specify here can be modified from the <a href="#PCemail">customization
page</a>, and also from the PC membership page.<br/><br/>
</dt>
</dt>
<dt><a name="adminEmail"></a><b>Administrator email.</b>
The administrator's email is rarly used by the software: it's main purpose
is to serve as a backup address for the chai'r email. For example, if the
need arise to reset the chair's password, then an email with the new password
will be sent to both the chair and the adminsitator email addresses. Also,
there are some rare error situations where the software would sends an email
to the administrator. After it is set, the administrator email can only be
changed by manually editing the file <tt>init/confParams.php</tt> under the
BASE directory.
</dt>
</dl>
<h4>After Initialization</h4>
Once you hit the Submit button at the bottom of the initialization form,
you are taken directly to the customization page in order to customize the
site for the conference (<a href="#customize">see below</a>). At this point
the web server no longer needs to write to the <tt>"init"</tt> subdirectory,
so you can change the permissions to make that directory read-only.

<a name="noWebBased"></a><h3>1b. Non-web-based installation</h3>
An alternative method of installation (in Unix systems) is to change
directory to where you unzipped this software (above the <tt>"webtree"</tt>
and <tt>"tools"</tt> directories) and from the command prompt do
<pre>
  % ./tools/mkNewConf.sh confname
</pre>
where confname is a short-name for the conference (e.g., <tt>xyz2007</tt>).
It is recommended that you read the script <tt>"mkNewConf.sh"</tt> before
running it, and you can optionally modify it to set some default values.<br/>
<br/>
This shell script will ask you for the locations of the BASE and UPLOAD
directories (and other parameters) and then it will install the software
in the BASE directory, setting the permissions as needed. The script will
then print out the username and password that are needed in order to access
the customization page. 


<a name="customize"></a><h2>2. First-time customization</h2>
Before it can be used, the site still needs to be customized for the
conference. This is done from the page <tt>chair/customize.php</tt> under the
BASE directory. This form lets the program chair specify the conference
name, deadlines, program-committee members and many other parameters.
Links are provided from this form to this documentation page, where you can
find some additional explanations about the role of different parameters.
All the parameters that are specified in this form can be modified later
from the administration page. Some fields in the customization form that
require more explanation are described below:

<dl>
<dt><a name="formats"></a><b>Supported Formats.</b> The software is very
permissive in terms of handling formats other than the ones that you specify
here. If a submitter uploads a file in an unsupported format, the only
thing that happens is that the extension <tt>unsupported</tt> is added
to the file name. (For example, uploading a file <tt>xyz.txt</tt>, the
file will be stored as <tt>xyz.txt.unsupported</tt>.<br/><br/>
</dt>
<dt><a name="PCemail"></a><b>Program Committee.</b>
In this section you must enter the PC chair's email address, and you can
optionally also specify the names and email addresses of the program
committee members. For each PC member (or chair) you can specify either just
an email address or also the name (in the form <tt>Name &lt;email&gt;</tt>).
If you do not specify the chair's name, it will default to something like
<tt>"&lt;conf-name&gt; Chair"</tt>. For the other members, if you do not
specify the name then it will remain blank.<br/>
<br/>
The email addresses that you specify here will be used as the username
for the purpose of accessing the review site. The names will be displayed
on the reviews and discussion boards. All the names and addresses that
you supply here can later be modified (or added or removed) from the
administration page. <br/><br/>
</dt>
<dt><a name="revPrefs"></a><b>Reviewer Preferences.</b> If you check this
box, PC members will see a link on the review page asking them to specify
their reviewing preferences. The chair will then be able to see all these
preferences and can take them into account in assigning submissions to
reviewers. Moreover, the chair will be given the option to let the software
automatically compute an assignment or submissions to reviewers based on
these preferences.
UNchecking this box will turn off reviewer preferences, and also disable
the automatic assignment option.<br/><br/>
</dt>
<dt><a name="revAttach"></a><b>Reviewer Attachments.</b> Check this box to
allow the reviewers to upload a file as an attachment to their review. This
file is considered part of the comments to authors, and will be attached to
the comments that are emailed to the authors at the end of the review process.
<a href="reviewer.html#revAttach">Click here</a> for some considerations for
and against allowing this option.
</dl>

<h4>After Customization</h4>
Once you hit the Submit button at the bottom of the customization page,
you are taken to a confirmation page where you can once again verify all
the parameters. Then the software is customized with these parameters
and you are presented with a receipt page. That page includes the chair's
password and links to the submission page and the administration page. The
submission site is now ready to receive submissions, and you can use the
administration page to manage it.



<a name="adminPage"></a><h2>3. The Administration Page</h2>
The administration page is what you use the manage the site and the entire
submission and review process. The links on that page change according
to the different phases of the process. You have one set of links during
the submission phase, another during the review phase, and yet others
during and after the final-version submission phase. You also have some
"general purpose" links there for changing your password, looking at the
error-log file, reading the documentation, etc.<br/>
<br/> 
You also have an "Undo/Redo" link that lets you either undo the last
change that you did from the administration page, or redo the last
change that you undid. For example, if you closed the submission site
and the decided to reopen it, you can use the Undo link to do that.



<a name="manageSubmissions"></a><h2>4. Managing the submission site</h2>
The administration page for the submission site is fairly simple. The
main things that you can do from that page are:
<ul>
<li>You can see a list of all the (non-withdrawn) submissions.</li>

<li>You can review and modify many of the submission-site parameters that
you specified during customization, including the conference submission
deadline.</li>

<li>You can tweak some parameters of the web-site (mainly email settings)
as <a href="#emailSettings">described below</a>.</li> 

<li>Finally, when the submission deadline passes you can close the submission
site and activate the review site. Clicking this last link will take you to
a confirmation page, where you can confirm that you really want to close the
submissions. The same page also lets you modify some of the review parameters
that you specified during customization.</li>
</ul>

You will also see on the administration phase links to some pages that
deal with review-period activities, such as setting the review guidelines,
managing PC membership and setting up PC votes. These are described
in more details below.

<a name="emailSettings"></a><h3>4a. Tweaking Email Settings</h3>
This form is meant to provide some workarounds common bugs and
configuration errors in email systems. It currently consists
of the following options:<br/><br/>
</dt>
<b>Email header-line separation.</b> RFC 2822 specifies that different
lines in the email header should be separated using the two characters 
<tt>\r\n</tt> (CRLF). However, the documentation for the
<a href="http://www.php.net/function.mail">PHP mail function</a>
contains  the following comment:
<blockquote>
<b>Note:</b>If messages are not received, try using a LF (\n) only. Some poor
quality Unix mail transfer agents replace LF by CRLF automatically (which
leads to doubling CR if CRLF is used). This should be a last resort, as it
does not comply with RFC 2822.
</blockquote>
Accordingly, the default setting that is used in the software is CRLF, but
you have the option to override that default.<br/><br/> 

<b>X-Mailer Header Line.</b> 
Sending this header line is considered standard net etiquette, but some
spam-filters out there mark as spam anything that has this header line.
UNcheck this box if this causes email loss.<br/><br/>

<b>Sender Header Line.</b>
If you know how the web-server is calling itself on email messages that
it sends, you can specify it here. This is often something like
<tt>userName@machineName</tt> where <tt>userName</tt> is the username of the
web-server (e.g., <tt>www</tt>, <tt>apache</tt>, <tt>admin</tt>, etc.) and
<tt>machineName</tt> is either the DNS name of the machine (e.g.,
<tt>www.mit.edu</tt>) or sometimes just <tt>localhost</tt>.<br/><br/>

When the web-server sends email, the name of the web-server itself is set
as the "envelope sender" of this message. It was observed that some ISPs
filter as spam email messages where the <tt>From:</tt> header line does not
match the "envelope sender". Hopefully specifying a matching <tt>"Sender:"</tt>
line would prevent these emails from being discarded.<br/><br/>

<b>Specify "envelope sender".</b>
Sometimes you can explicitly specify the "envelope sender" to be used, by
supplying the parameter <tt>"-f name-to-use"</tt> to the PHP mail function.
This only works on (some) Unix systems, and does not work when PHP is in "safe
mode". Also, using this option typically adds an <tt>"X-Warning:"</tt> header
line to the message, which can again increase the odds of this message being
discarded en-route. The <a href="http://www.php.net/function.mail">PHP
documentation</a> has the following comment about this method:
<blockquote>
The user that the web server runs as should be added as a trusted user to
the sendmail configuration to prevent a 'X-Warning' header from being added
to the message when the envelope sender (-f) is set using this method. For
sendmail users, this file is <tt>/etc/mail/trusted-users</tt>.
</blockquote>

<a name="manageReview"></a><h2>5. Managing the review site</h2>
Once you close the submission site, you are taken back to the administration
page, where you can now administer the review site. At the top-right corner
you still have a "Submission-site" box, now consisting only of a few links 
that let you list the submissions is various orders (and also revise or
withdraw submissions if need be). You can even submit a new papers (just in
case you want to accept for consideration a submission that arrived after
the deadline.) 

<a name="revSetUp"></a><h3>5a. Initial set-up</h3>
One of the first things that you would want to do after the deadline
(if not before) is letting the PC members access the review site. This
is done from the "Manage PC membership" page. On that page you can add
or remove PC members, reset the password of a PC member and modify the
email address or the name  that is recorded in the database for each
member. The PC members can login to the site using their email address
and password. When you reset the password of a PC member, an email
message is sent to that member with the new password. (Also, changing
the email address of a PC member automatically resets his/her
password.) Note that it is possible for several people to use the same
email address as long as they use different passwords (but all the
passwords will be sent to that one email address).<br/>
<br/>
Other things that you can do from the administration page is to create
an archive file with all the submissions (so that reviewers do not need
to download each submission separately), and edit the review-guideline page.
The review guidelines page consists of the grade semantics, important dates
in the committee work (such as the individual review deadline), and other
review policies. 

<a name="assign"></a>
<h3>5b. Paper assignments and blocking access to papers</h3>
The software also lets you assign some submissions to each reviewer or
block reviewers from accessing specific submissions (e.g., blocking PC
members from accessing the reviews of their own papers).<br/>
<br/>
If you did not disable that option, then PC members are given the option
to access a Reviewing-Preferences page where they can specify what
submissions they want or do not want to review, and they can also
specify if they feel that they have conflict of interest with some
submissions.  All these preferences are made available to the chair,
should you want to use them in assigning or blocking access to submissions.
<ul>
<li>
On the Blocking-Access page you are presented with a list of all the PC
members, and for each member you are given a list of the submission-ID's
that that member specified as having conflict-of-interests with. For each
PC member you can then specify a list of submissions that this member should
be barred from seeing. You are then asked again to confirm these choices, and
once you do the submissions that you specified are removed from the view of
that PC member. (You can access the Blocking-Access page at any time during
the review process, should you need to modify these decisions.)<br/><br/></li>
<li>
For the task of assigning submissions to reviewers, you are given the choice
to either assign everything manually, or to let the software compute an
assignment (using the reviewer's preferences) that you can later adjust.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Automatically Computing Paper Assignments</h4>
If you did not disable that option, you will find a link off the 
administration page that points to the auto-assignment page, where you can
have the software compute an assignment of submissions to reviewers. The
software uses a Stable-Marriage-like algorithm to generate this assignment,
as described next.<br/>
<br/>
<a name="chairPrefs"></a>
Recall that in a (generalized) stable-marriage problem, you have a bipartite
graph (which in our case represent reviewers and submissions) where each node
on the left can potentially have preferences about nodes on the right and
vise versa. Also, there are parameters that specify for each node X in the
graph the maximum number of nodes from the other side that can be matched
to X (i.e., the maximum degree of X). A solution to this problem is some
subset of the edges of the complete bipartite graph that satisfies all the
maximum-degree constraints. A solution is maximal if you cannot add any
edges to it without violating the maximum-degree constraint of one of
the nodes. A solution is called <i>unstable</i> is there exist two nodes
X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub> on the left and two nodes Y<sub>1</sub>,
Y<sub>2</sub> on the right such that:
<ul>
<li>X<sub>1</sub> is matched to Y<sub>1</sub> but not to Y<sub>2</sub>,
and X<sub>2</sub> is matched to Y<sub>2</sub> but not to Y<sub>1</sub>; and
</li>
<li>X<sub>1</sub> prefers Y<sub>2</sub> to Y<sub>1</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub>
does not prefers X<sub>2</sub> over X<sub>1</sub>. 
</li>
</ul>
(This is unstable since X<sub>1</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub> are motivated to
dump Y<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> respectively and elope together.) A
solution is <i>stable</i> is there are no two such pairs. It is well
known <a href="#stableMarriageBook">[1]</a> that one can employ a greedy
algorithm to compute a stable maximal solution in time proportional to the
number of edges in the complete bipartite graph.<br/>
<br/>
In our case, the PC members specify their preferences for the submissions
that they want to review, thus establishing preferences from left to right.
In the other direction, the chair is given the opportunity on the Auto-Assign
page to specify preferences as to who should (or shouldn't) review what
submission, thus establishing preferences from right to left. Note that
specifying that "I prefer that Joe is assigned to submission 53" is
different than manually assigning submission 53 to Joe. Specifically, this
is just a hint to the software and is not binding, which means that you can
specify as many preferences as you want without having to worry about
load balancing and such like.<br/>
<br/>
<a name="exRevs"></a>
Once you got the preferences from all the PC members and also specified
your own preferences, you are ready to let the software compute the initial
assignments for you. Before the algorithm is run, however, you have to
specify some parameters. In particular, you can specify a list of <b>
excluded reviewers</b> that will be hidden from the view of the algorithm.
This means that the algorithm will completely ignore these reviewers: they
will not be assigned any submissions and existing assignments that they have
will not be removed. Also, such existing assignments (if any) will not be
counted against the number of required reviews per submission. You can use
this option, for example, if one of the "PC members" on your list is the
PC chair (to whom you do not want to assign any submissions).<br/>
<br/> 
Other parameters that you need to specify are how many reviewers are
assigned for each submission and whether or not you want to keep existing
assignments (if any) or start from scratch.
Once you specify all the parameters, the software automatically computes
an assignment of submissions to reviewers, and you are taken to the
manual-assignment page where you can review and modify this assignment.

<h4>Manually Assigning Submissions to Reviewers</h4>
The manual-assignment page provides you with two different interfaces that
you can use to specify the reviewing assignments. You can use either of these
interfaces as you see fit, and once you "save the assignments" with one
interface, the other interface is automatically updated as well. 
<ul>
<li><b>The matrix interface:</b> This interface consists of a matrix
of check-boxes, with one column for each PC member and one row for each
submission. At the bottom of each column you can see the number of submissions
that are assigned to that PC member, and at the right end of each row you
can see how many reviewers are assigned to that submission. <i>Note, however,
that these counters are only updated when you click the "save assignments"
button.</i><br/>
<br/>
Every entry in the matrix also displays the
preferences that the PC member specified for that submission, encoded as
a number between 0 and 5 and colored from red to green (if nothing appears
in the entry, it means that the PC member specified the default number 3).
Also, if you <a href="#chairPrefs">specified some preferences</a> from
the auto-assign page, then the checkbox itself will be colored either
red (should not review) or green (should review).<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li><b>The submission-list interface:</b>
This interface consists of a list of submissions, where for each submission
you can specify a list of PC members that are assigned to that submission.
</li>
</ul>
<a name="scratchAssign"></a>
<h4>Scratch Assignments vs. Visible Assignments</h4>
The assignments that are automatically computed by the software or set
from the manual assignment page are stored as a "scratch copy" that is
only visible to the chair but not to the reviewers. This allows the
chair to play around with the assignments before making them publically
available.<br/>
<br/>
To make the assignments visible to the reviewers, the chair must check
the box to "Make these assignments visible to the reviewers" next to
the "Save Assignments" button on either the matrix or the list interface. 
Hitting the "Save Assignments" button with this box checked will copy
the scratch assignments to the visible assignments, thus letting the
reviewers see their assigned papers. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Note:</b> As opposed to paper assignments, setting or clearing 
conflict-of-interests status for papers will immediately be visible to the
reviewers. 


<a name="track"></a><h3>5c. Tracking progress</h3>
After you assigned the reviewing duties, you can track the progress of the
reviewing process off the administration page. The Overview page shows a
matrix of all PC members and submissions, and each entry in that matrix
shows whether a PC member is assigned to a submissions and whether it
entered a review of it. If the PC member entered a review for the submission,
you can click on the entry to see that review. At the bottom of the
page you can manage the "discuss flags" that let PC members see each
other's comments and participate in the discussions.<br/>
<br/>
At any time you can go to the Set Submission Status page where you can
modify the status of any submission. The available status values are the
usual ones,  namely "No status", "Reject", "Maybe Reject", "Discuss",
"Maybe accept", and "Accept". At the top of the Overview and Set-Status
pages you can see how many submissions are currently assigned any of the
status values.<br/>
<br/>
Also, at any time you can also go from the Administration page to the
Review page (via the links at the top and bottom of the page), where you
can participate in the review and discussions just like any other PC member.

<a name="votes"></a><h3>5d. Program-committee votes</h3>
The software includes support for setting up and managing program-committee
votes. You can have the committee vote on things such as "what papers to
move from 'Discuss' to 'Maybe Accept'", or "which of the accepted papers
should receive the best paper award", or even "who will give the invited
talk at the conference".
Managing the votes is done from the Voting page. On that page you can
set the parameters for a new ballot, edit the paremeters of the ballots
that are currently in progress, and see a list of all the ballots (in
progrress and otherwise) with a link to the result page for each one.<br/>
<br/>
You can det up a ballot to vote either on submissions or on "other
things" (that you need to specify explicitly). Note that PC members can
only vote on submissions when they are in the public-discussion phase of
the review. Before that they can only vote on "other things" (e.g.,
invited speakers).<br/>
<br/>
When voting on submissions, you can either include all the submissions
in the vote, include only submissions from specific categories (e.g., only
submissions in the "Discuss" category), or explicitly list the submissions
that you want to include in the vote.
Note that if you choose to include in the vote, say, all the submissions
in the "Discuss" category, then the submissions that the PC members see
when they vote are the ones in the "Discuss" category <i>at the time that
they are voting</i>. Put in other words: adding or removing submissions
to the "Discuss" category in mid-vote will add or remove these submissions
from the ballot.<br/>
<br/>
When you set up ballots, the PC members will see a link from their review
page that lets them participate in the current ballots, and you will be
able to track the voting results off the Voting page. You can also modify
the parameters of a vote, even when this vote is already in progress. 
Note that if you modify the list of submission-IDs or the list of "other
things to vote on" in mid-vote, you must make sure that you do not modify the
order of items, since the software identifies vote-items with their position
in the list. For example, swapping the order of two items will result in each
of them being assigned the tally of the other.

<a name="wrap"></a><h3>5e. Wrapping up the PC work</h3>
After all the decisions are made, the software lets you send to the authors
the notification of decisions and the comments-to-authors that were entered
during the review period. Just follow the appropriate link off the
administration page, and you will be given the opportunity to edit these
emails before they are sent. In addition to the contact authors, the chair
is also CCed on all these emails.<br/> 
<br/> 
Note that the Notification and Comments pages <i>only send emails to contact
authors of submissions whose status is either "Accept" or "Reject"</i>. 
These pages give you the choice of either sending emails to the contact
authors of all the accepted and rejected submissions, or only to specific
submissions that you explicitly list. This can be used to hold off on
sending emails to some submissions (by setting their status to something
other than "Accept" or "Reject") and later assigning the correct status
and specifying these submission explicitly. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to keep all the reviews and discussions for future reference,
you can find a link off the administration page that packs all of them in
one text ascii page that you can then save for your files.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, you have a link to close the review site and activate the site
for final-version submission. This link takes you to a confirmation page,
where you can also edit the camera-version submission instructions that
will be sent to the contact authors of accepted papers. (Once the review
site is closed, PC members can still access the site and read the comments
and discussions, but they can no longer modify them.)

<a name="manageFinal"></a><h2>6. Managing the final-version submission site</h2>
After you activated the final-version submission site, you still see a 
"Review site" box at the top right corner of the administration page, that
lets you send emails to authors or change the status of submissions if
need be. Other than that, you can see a list of accepted papers (with
links to the final version when it is uploaded), create (and then download)
an archive file containing the final versions of all the accepted papers,
or send email to the authors of all the accepted papers (e.g., to remind
everyone that the deadline is in three days).<br/>
<br/>
When the camera-ready deadline arrives, you can shutdown the final-version
submission site. After you do that, you are given yet another link that
automates the creation of the various indexes for the proceedings.
Specifically, you are given the option of specifying the order in which
the papers will appear in the proceedings and the length of each paper,
and then the software generates for you a LaTeX file (using Springer
llncs style) that includes the external-reviewer list, the list of
program committee members, the table-of-contents and the author index.
