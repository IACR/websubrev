<a name="insall"></a><h2>1. Installing the software</h2>
One of the goals of this software was to make administration as easy as
possible. In particular, you never need to run scripts etc. In principle,
to install this software you just unpack the zip file in some directory
in your web tree (call it the BASE directory), point your browser at that
directory and off you go.

<h3>Some caveats</h3>
This software is currently a PHP/MySQL software, which means that to
use it you must have a MySQL server and a PHP engine (and your web-server
must supports PHP and MySQL). I tested the software with PHP 4.3.2 and
MySQL 3.23 (both quite old now). It may work with even older versions
(but it may not). Also, the proper functioning of this software depend
on "proper" functioning of you web-server. In particular, two issues that
I came across are:
<ul>
<li> The scripts must be able to write and create sub-directories in the
  BASE directory. When using this software on Linux with an Apache
  server (running as user <tt>apache</tt>), I had to chdir to the BASE
  directory and make sure the directory and all the files in it are owned
  by user <tt>apache</tt>.
</li>

<li> The web-server (and the PHP engine) must be willing to upload files.
  For example, in one system that I used to test it, the PHP engine was
  configured to only allow uploads of files upto 500KB (and I was wrecking
  my brains as to why I can only upload pdf and not postscript files..)
  In my case it turned out that I had to change the parameter
  <tt>LimitRequestBody</tt> in php.conf (which on that system was somewhere
  under <tt>/etc/httpd/</tt>).
</li>
</ul>
<b>Experimenting with the software.</b>
I wrote a small testing package for the purpose
of experimenting with the software. To use this package, you just need
to unpack it in the same BASE directory as the software package itself
(<i>before</i> you customize the installation). This testing package adds
53 dummy submissions and 17 dummy PC members to the conference database.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Troubleshooting.</b> Most of the parameters of the software are stored 
in the file <tt>includes/confConstants.php</tt> under the BASE directory.
(This file is generated by the customize page which is discussed below.)
If you have problems with the software, looking at this file may provide
some hints as to the source of the problem.


<a name="customize"></a><h2>2. First-time customization</h2>
When you first point your browser to a virgin copy of the software, it
takes you to a "customization page" where you customize this copy for
your conference. In this page you specify things like the conference name,
the PC chair email address, whether or not submissions are anonymous, and
many other parameters. Nearly all the parameters that you specify in this
page can later by modified from the conference administration page. Some
fields in the customization form that require more explanation are described
below:

<dl>
<dt><a name="webServer"></a><b>Web Server.</b> 
The DNS name or IP address of the web server, as accessed by the users of
this software. This parameter is used when the software sends emails and
needs to specify the address where some pages can be found. (Note that
in some cases the administrator may use a different address. For example,
the administrator uses "<tt>http://localhost/confName/</tt>" while everybody
else uses "<tt>http://www.severName.org/confName/</tt>").
<br/><br/> 
</dt>

<dt><a name="SQLserver"></a><b>MySQL Server.</b> 
This parameter tells the PHP scripts where to look for the MySQL server. In
common installations the same host runs both the web-server and the MySQL
server. If this is not the case (i.e., the web server communicates with a
back-end database that is hosted on a different machine) then you need to
check the radio-button for "The MySQL server runs on a different host" and
provide the DNS name or IP address of the machine that hosts the MySQL server.
<br/><br/> 
</dt>

<dt><a name="SQLuser"></a>
<b>MySQL Administrator or MySQL Database and User.</b>
There are two ways to create a database for use with the submission and review
software:</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If you have administrative access to the MySQL server, you can simply
enter the administrator username and password and the software will
automatically create a new database. The "administrator" whose details are
thus specified should have sufficient privileges to DROP and CREATE databases
and to GRANT access privileges on these databases.<br/>
<br/></li>

<li>If you do not know the username/password of the MySQL administrator,
you should create the database for this conference by some other means.
(For example, some hosted sites have a "control panel" that lets users
create new databases. In other sites one must ask the administrator to
create new databases.)<br/>
<br/> 
Once you created the database, enter in the form the database name and the
MySQL username/password that are needed to access it.</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/> 
</dd>

<dt><a name="emailSettings"></a>
<b>Email Settings.</b> This section is meant to provide some workarounds 
common bugs and configuration errors in email systems. It currently consists
of two fields:<br/>
</dt>
<dd><b>Email header-line separation:</b> RFC 2822 specifies that different
lines in the email header should be separated using the two characters 
<tt>\r\n</tt> (CRLF). However, the documentation for the
<a href="http://www.php.net/function.mail">PHP mail function</a>
contains  the following comment:
<blockquote>
<b>Note:</b>If messages are not received, try using a LF (\n) only. Some poor
quality Unix mail transfer agents replace LF by CRLF automatically (which
leads to doubling CR if CRLF is used). This should be a last resort, as it
does not comply with RFC 2822.
</blockquote>
Accordingly, the default setting that is used in the software is CRLF, but
you have the option to override that default.<br/><br/> 
</dd>

<dd><b>Extra parameters for sendmail:</b> It was observed that some ISP's
filter as spam email messages where the <tt>From</tt> line does not match
the "envelope sender". When email messages are sent from the web-server,
the <tt>From</tt> line is set to the PC chair email address but the "envelope
sender" is the web-server itself (e.g., <tt>apache@local-machine</tt>). 
This situation leads to loss of email messages in some cases. 
A counter-measure that sometimes helps is to explicitly tell the 
mail-transport-agent to set also the "envelope sender" to the chair's email
address, using the extra parameter <tt>-f &lt;chair-email&gt;</tt>. 
<!-- (As far as I know, this only works on Unix systems that are
configured to have the mail-trasport-agent running on the local machine.) -->
The <a href="http://www.php.net/function.mail">PHP documentation</a>
has the following comment about this method:
<blockquote>
The user that the web server runs as should be added as a trusted user to
the sendmail configuration to prevent a 'X-Warning' header from being added
to the message when the envelope sender (-f) is set using this method. For
sendmail users, this file is <tt>/etc/mail/trusted-users</tt>.
</blockquote>
Also, this method does not work with PHP in "safe mode", so this parameter is
ignored when the web-server is configured to use "safe mode" PHP.<br/>
<br/>
</dd>
<dt><a name="PCemail"></a><b>Program Chair and Program Committee email.</b>
In this section you must enter the PC chair's email address, and you can
optionally also specify the names and email addresses of the program
committee members. For each PC member (or chair) you can specify either just
an email address or also the name (in the form <tt>Name &lt;email&gt;</tt>).
If you do not specify the chair's name, it will default to something like
<tt>"&lt;conf-name&gt; Chair"</tt>. For the other members, if you do not
specify the name then it will remain blank.<br/>
<br/>
The email addresses that you specify here will be used as the username
for the purpose of accessing the review site. The names will be displayed
on the reviews and discussion boards. All the names and addresses that
you supply here can later be modified (or added or removed) from the
administration page. <br/><br/>
</dt>
<dt><a name="formats"></a><b>Supported Formats.</b> The software is very
permissive in terms of handling formats other than the ones that you specify
here. If a submitter uploads a file in an unsupported format, the only
thing that happens is that the extension <tt>unsupported</tt> is added
to the file name. (For example, uploading a file <tt>xyz.txt</tt>, the
file will be stored as <tt>xyz.txt.unsupported</tt>.<br/><br/>
</dt>
<dt><a name="revPrefs"></a><b>Reviewer Preferences.</b> If you check this
box, PC members will see a link on the review page asking them to specify
their reviewing preferences. The chair will then be able to see all these
preferences and can take them into account in assigning submissions to
reviewers. Moreover, the chair will be given the option to let the software
automatically compute an assignment or submissions to reviewers based on
these preferences.
UNchecking this box will turn off reviewer preferences, and also disable
the automatic assignment option.
</dt>
</dl>

<h3>After Customization</h3>
Once you hit the Submit button at the bottom of the customization page,
you are taken to a confirmation page where you can once again verify all
the parameters. Then the software is customized with these parameters, 
and (if all goes well) you are presented with a receipt page. That page
includes the chair's initial password and links to the submission page
and the administration page. The submission site is now ready to receive
submissions, and you can use the administration page to manage it.

<a name="adminPage"></a><h2>3. The Administration Page</h2>
The administration page is what you use the manage the site and the entire
submission and review process. The links on that page change according to
the different phases of the process. You have one set of links during
the submission phase, another during the review phase, and yet others
during and after the final-version submission phase. You also have some
"general purpose" links there for changing your password, looking at the
error-log file, reading the documentation etc.<br/>
<br/> 
You also have an "Undo/Redo" link that lets you either undo the last
change that you did from the administration page, or redo the last
change that you undid. For example, if you closed the submission site
and the decided to reopen it, you can use the Undo link to do that.
Note, however, that only the last change that you made is kept, so 
you cannot undo multiple operations.

<a name="manageSubmissions"></a><h2>4. Managing the submission site</h2>
The administration page for the submission site is fairly simple. There are
three things that you can do from that page:
<ul>
<li>You can see a list of all the (non-withdrawn) submissions.</li>

<li>You can review and modify many of the submission-site parameters that
you specified during customization, including the conference submission
deadline and the web-site <a href="#emailSettings">email settings</a>. 

<li>Finally, when the submission deadline passes you can close the
submission site and activate the review site. Clicking this last link
will take you to a confirmation page, where you can confirm that you really
want to close the submissions. The same page also lets you modify some of
the review parameters that you specified during customization.</li>
</ul>

You will also see on the administration phase links to some pages that
deal with review-period activities, such as setting the review guidelines,
managing PC membership and setting up PC votes. These are described
in more details below.

<a name="manageReview"></a><h2>5. Managing the review site</h2>
Once you close the submission site, your are taken back to the administration
page, where you can now administer the review site. At the top-right corner
you still have a "Submission-site" box, now consisting only of one link 
that lets you revise or withdraw submissions if need be. (Note that you
can also have submit new papers, just in case you want to accept a
submission that arrived after the deadline.)

<a name="revSetUp"></a><h3>5a. Initial set-up</h3>
One of the first things that you would want to do after the deadline is
letting the PC members access the review site. This is done from the
"Manage PC membership" page. On that page you can add or remove PC members,
reset the password of a PC member and modify the email address or the name 
that is recorded in the database for each member.
The PC members can login to the site using their email address and 
password. When you reset the password of a PC member, an email message is
sent to that member with the new password. (Also, changing the email address
of a PC member automatically resets his/her password.) Note that it is
possible for several people to use the same email address as long as
they use different passwords (but all the passwords will be sent to that
one email address).<br/>
<br/>
Other things that you can do from the administration page is to create
an archive file with all the submissions (so that reviewers do not need
to download each submission separately), and edit the review-guideline page.
The review guidelines page consists of the grade semantics, important dates
in the committee work (such as the individual review deadline), and other
review policies. 

<a name="assign"></a>
<h3>5b. Paper assignments and blocking access to papers</h3>
The software also lets you assign some submissions to each reviewer or
block reviewers from accessing specific submissions (e.g., blocking PC
members from accessing the reviews of their own papers).<br/>
<br/>
If you did not disable that option, then PC members are given the option
to access a Reviewing-Preferences page where they can specify what
submissions they want or do not want to review, and they can also
specify if they feel that they have conflict of interest with some
submissions.  All these preferences are made available to the chair,
should you want to use them in assigning or blocking access to submissions.
<ul>
<li>
On the Blocking-Access page you are presented with a list of all the PC
members, and for each member you are given a list of the submission-ID's
that that member specified as having conflict-of-interests with. For each
PC member you can then specify a list of submissions that this member should
be barred from seeing. You are then asked again to confirm these choices, and
once you do the submissions that you specified are removed from the view of
that PC member. (You can access the Blocking-Access page at any time during
the review process, should you need to modify these decisions.)<br/><br/></li>
<li>
For the task of assigning submissions to reviewers, you are given the choice
to either assign everything manually, or to let the software compute an
assignment (using the reviewer's preferences) that you can later adjust.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Automatically Computing Paper Assignments</h4>
If you did not disable that option, you will find a link off the 
administration page that points to the auto-assignment page, where you can
have the software compute an assignment of submissions to reviewers. The
software uses a Stable-Marriage-like algorithm to generate this assignment,
as described next.<br/>
<br/>
<a name="chairPrefs"></a>
Recall that in a (generalized) stable-marriage problem, you have a bipartite
graph (which in our case represent reviewers and submissions) where each node
on the left can potentially have preferences about nodes on the right and
vise versa. Also, there are parameters that specify for each node X in the
graph the maximum number of nodes from the other side that can be matched
to X (i.e., the maximum degree of X). A solution to this problem is some
subset of the edges of the complete bipartite graph that satisfies all the
maximum-degree constraints. A solution is maximal if you cannot add any
edges to it without violating the maximum-degree constraint of one of
the nodes. A solution is called <i>unstable</i> is there exist two nodes
X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub> on the left and two nodes Y<sub>1</sub>,
Y<sub>2</sub> on the right such that:
<ul>
<li>X<sub>1</sub> is matched to Y<sub>1</sub> but not to Y<sub>2</sub>,
and X<sub>2</sub> is matched to Y<sub>2</sub> but not to Y<sub>1</sub>; and
</li>
<li>X<sub>1</sub> prefers Y<sub>2</sub> to Y<sub>1</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub>
does not prefers X<sub>2</sub> over X<sub>1</sub>. 
</li>
</ul>
(This is unstable since X<sub>1</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub> are motivated to
dump Y<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> respectively and elope together.) A
solution is <i>stable</i> is there are no two such pairs. It is well
known <a href="#stableMarriageBook">[1]</a> that one can employ a greedy
algorithm to compute a stable maximal solution in time proportional to the
number of edges in the complete bipartite graph.<br/>
<br/>
In our case, the PC members specify their preferences for the submissions
that they want to review, thus establishing preferences from left to right.
In the other direction, the chair is given the opportunity on the Auto-Assign
page to specify preferences as to who should (or shouldn't) review what
submission, thus establishing preferences from right to left. Note that
specifying that "I prefer that Joe is assigned to submission 53" is
different than manually assigning submission 53 to Joe. Specifically, this
is just a hint to the software and is not binding, which means that you can
specify as many preferences as you want without having to worry about
load balancing and such like.<br/>
<br/>
<a name="exRevs"></a>
Once you got the preferences from all the PC members and also specified
your own preferences, you are ready to let the software compute the initial
assignments for you. Before the algorithm is run, however, you have to
specify some parameters. In particular, you can specify a list of <b>
excluded reviewers</b> that will be hidden from the view of the algorithm.
This means that the algorithm will completely ignore these reviewers: they
will not be assigned any submissions and existing assignments that they have
will not be removed. Also, such existing assignments (if any) will not be
counted against the number of required reviews per submission. You can use
this option, for example, if one of the "PC members" on your list is the
PC chair (to whom you do not want to assign any submissions).<br/>
<br/> 
Other parameters that you need to specify are how many reviewers are
assigned for each submission and whether or not you want to keep existing
assignments (if any) or start from scratch.
Once you specify all the parameters, the software automatically computes
an assignment of submissions to reviewers, and you are taken to the
manual-assignment page where you can review and modify this assignment.

<h4>Manually Assigning Submissions to Reviewers</h4>
The manual-assignment page provides you with two different interfaces that
you can use to specify the reviewing assignments. You can use either of these
interfaces as you see fit, and once you "save the assignments" with one
interface, the other interface is automatically updated as well. 
<ul>
<li><b>The matrix interface:</b> This interface consists of a matrix
of check-boxes, with one column for each PC member and one row for each
submission. At the bottom of each column you can see the number of submissions
that are assigned to that PC member, and at the right end of each row you
can see how many reviewers are assigned to that submission. <i>Note, however,
that these counters are only updated when you click the "save assignments"
button.</i><br/>
<br/>
Every entry in the matrix also displays the
preferences that the PC member specified for that submission, encoded as
a number between 0 and 5 and colored from red to green (if nothing appears
in the entry, it means that the PC member specified the default number 3).
Also, if you <a href="#chairPrefs">specified some preferences</a> from
the auto-assign page, then the checkbox itself will be colored either
red (should not review) or green (should review).<br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li><b>The submission-list interface:</b>
This interface consists of a list of submissions, where for each submission
you can specify a list of PC members that are assigned to that submission.
</li>
</ul>
<a name="scratchAssign"></a>
<h4>Scratch Assignments vs. Visible Assignments</h4>
The assignments that are automatically computed by the software or set
from the manual assignment page are stored as a "scratch copy" that is
only visible to the chair but not to the reviewers. This allows the
chair to play around with the assignments before making them publically
available.<br/>
<br/>
To make the assignments visible to the reviewers, the chair must check
the box to "Make these assignments visible to the reviewers" next to
the "Save Assignments" button on either the matrix or the list interface. 
Hitting the "Save Assignments" button with this box checked will copy
the scratch assignments to the visible assignments, thus letting the
reviewers see their assigned papers. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Note:</b> As opposed to paper assignments, setting or clearing 
conflict-of-interests status for papers will immediately be visible to the
reviewers. 


<a name="track"></a><h3>5c. Tracking progress</h3>
After you assigned the reviewing duties, you can track the progress of the
reviewing process off the administration page. The Overview page shows a
matrix of all PC members and submissions, and each entry in that matrix
shows whether a PC member is assigned to a submissions and whether it
entered a review of it. If the PC member entered a review for the submission,
you can click on the entry to see that review. At the bottom of the
page you can manage the "discuss flags" that let PC members see each
other's comments and participate in the discussions.<br/>
<br/>
At any time you can go to the Set Submission Status page where you can
modify the status of any submission. The available status values are the
usual ones,  namely "No status", "Reject", "Maybe Reject", "Discuss",
"Maybe accept", and "Accept". At the top of the Overview and Set-Status
pages you can see how many submissions are currently assigned any of the
status values.<br/>
<br/>
Also, at any time you can also go from the Administration page to the
Review page (via the links at the top and bottom of the page), where you
can participate in the review and discussions just like any other PC member.

<a name="votes"></a><h3>5d. Program-committee votes</h3>
The software includes support for setting up and managing program-committee
votes. You can have the committee vote on things such as "what papers to
move from 'Discuss' to 'Maybe Accept'", or "which of the accepted papers
should receive the best paper award", or even "who will give the invited
talk at the conference".
Managing the votes is done from the Voting page. On that page you can
set the parameters for a new ballot, edit the paremeters of the ballots
that are currently in progress, and see a list of all the ballots (in
progrress and otherwise) with a link to the result page for each one.<br/>
<br/>
You can det up a ballot to vote either on submissions or on "other
things" (that you need to specify explicitly). Note that PC members can
only vote on submissions when they are in the public-discussion phase of
the review. Before that they can only vote on "ther things" (e.g.,
invited speakers).<br/>
<br/>
When voting on submissions, you can either include all the submissions
in the vote, include only submissions from specific categories (e.g., only
submissions in the "Discuss" category), or explicitly list the submissions
that you want to include in the vote.
Note that if you choose to include in the vote, say, all the submissions
in the "Discuss" category, then the submissions that the PC members see
when they vote are the ones in the "Discuss" category <i>at the time that
they are voting</i>. Put in other words: adding or removing submissions
to the "Discuss" category in mid-vote will add or remove these submissions
from the ballot.<br/>
<br/>
When you set up ballots, the PC members will see a link from their review
page that lets them participate in the current ballots, and you will be
able to track the voting results off the Voting page. 

<a name="wrap"></a><h3>5e. Wrapping up the PC work</h3>
After all the decisions are made, the software lets you send to the authors
the notification of decisions and the comments-to-authors that were entered
during the review period. Just follow the appropriate link off the
administration page, and you will be given the opportunity to edit these
emails before they are sent. In addition to the contact authors, the chair
is also CCed on all these emails.<br/> 
<br/> 
Note that the Notification and Comments pages <i>only send emails to contact
authors of submissions whose status is either "Accept" or "Reject"</i>. 
These pages give you the choice of either sending emails to the contact
authors of all the accepted and rejected submissions, or only to specific
submissions that you explicitly list. This can be used to hold off on
sending emails to some submissions (by setting their status to something
other than "Accept" or "Reject") and later assigning the correct status
and specifying these submission explicitly. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to keep all the reviews and discussions for future reference,
you can find a link off the administration page that packs all of them in
one text ascii page that you can then save for your files.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, you have a link to close the review site and activate the site
for final-version submission. This link takes you to a confirmation page,
where you can also edit the camera-version submission instructions that
will be sent to the contact authors of accepted papers. (Once the review
site is closed, PC members can still access the site and read the comments
and discussions, but they can no longer modify them.)

<a name="manageFinal"></a><h2>6. Managing the final-version submission site</h2>
After you activated the final-version submission site, you still see a 
"Review site" box at the top right corner of the administration page, that
lets you send emails to authors or change the status of submissions if
need be. Other than that, you can see a list of accepted papers (with
links to the final version when it is uploaded), and you can create (and
then download) an archive file containing the final versions of all the
accepted papers.<br/>
<br/>
When the camera-ready deadline arrives, you can shutdown the final-version
submission site. After you do that, you are given yet another link that
automates the creation of the various indexes for the proceedings.
Specifically, you are given the option of specifying the order in which
the papers will appear in the proceedings and the length of each paper,
and then the software generates for you a LaTeX file (using Springer
llncs style) that includes the external-reviewer list, the list of
program committee members, the table-of-contents and the author index.
